*I created this to carve a little slice of my own in the vastness of the internet :) Below is a little bit about me:*

#### The Pitch

Enthusiastic software engineer and teacher. My first love was Ruby on Rails, but I've since worked with NodeJS, TypeScript, Python, Elixir, and PHP. With that, Postgres/SQL, Mongo/NoSQL, Redis, Heroku, Elasticsearch, MQTT, Kafka, Unix, Materialize...lots :) 

I like well tested, well documented code, and, of course, well _designed_ code. I prefer simple and explicit over complex ("Cool one liner, but what does it _do_?") and implicit.

I will talk at length about Functional Programming, OOP, Domain Driven Design, and SOLID...or any pattern, really.

I have an interest in ops. I love to work with Terraform and Dockerize _everything_. I know AWS...just kidding, I've worked with _parts_ of it. I have had enough IAM headaches to know best practices around that roles and users, though.

I am learning...everything! But in all seriousness, if I had to name a few, event driven architecture, Kubernetes, SecOps, ETLs, Lua, Deno, WASM, Rust, ML, diving deeper in to OTP, uhh...the list goes on. So many toys, so little time!

#### The Other Stuff

I'm a firm believer in open source and sharing knowledge. I will teach any chance any chance I get and learn any chance I get.

I taught professionally for several years and the experience was extremely fulfilling. Sure, explaining concepts reinforces your understanding but the ability to make a difference in an individuals life was more humbling and rewarding than I could have imagined.

In all areas of my life, the following is true:

*Community is simply more important.*

Oh, HJKL <3

#### The Other Other Stuff

I mostly code or [play with and in userland](https://github.com/essn/dotfiles), but if I'm not...I enjoy (in no particular order):

- My two cats - Peanut and Paisely (yes, the names are on purpose)
- Spending time with my friends and family
- Audio synthesis (I code it too sometimes!) and compulsively collecting related hardware
- [Rinsing my vinyl collection](https://www.discogs.com/user/essn/collection) for fun and profit (to the dismay of my neighbors)
- Cooking
- Attempting to understand the meaning of life (read: likes science fiction)
- Exploring the vastness of NYC

#### Read This Bit Please

I am currently having a love affair with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and promoting it as much as I can.
